This app has four sections:

* Add Todo- To add new todo.
* Complete Todos-Displays the list of completed todos
* Deleted Todos-Displays the list of deleted todos.

To mark an active todo as complete todo click the checkbox button on left of todo.
Clicking the checkbox on left of completed todo makes the todo active again and added
